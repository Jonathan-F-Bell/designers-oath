                <h2>Designer's Oath</h2>
                <p>I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant: I will <a href="#">respect</a> the hard-won knowledge of the human condition of those designers in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such empathetic decisions as are mine with those who are to follow.</p>
                <p>I will apply, for the benefit of all people and their dignity, all measures that are human-centered and holistic avoiding those twin traps of behavioral manipulation and pure profitability.</p>
